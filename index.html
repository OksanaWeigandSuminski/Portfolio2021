					<p>
						Hi There,
						I'm a web developer with a keen interest in contributing to society through my work. I love structure, order, and quality. I enjoy spending time fixing little details and looking for solutions to a problem.
 						I like working in a team as much as on my own. I'm both curious and skeptical of emerging technologies. If you have a project or creative need that I can help with, please get in touch.
					</p>
					<!-- <button class="accordion">Continue Reading <img src="images/down2.png" style="width: 28px; padding-left: 10px;"> </button>
					<p class="panel">As an adolescent, my first computer, one of the first computers in my hometown, allowed me and my brother and even my neighbors life-changing experiences. 
						I want to devote my work to research that creates opportunities to make a difference in people's lives. I hope to work as a software engineer with specialization in Machine Learning. 
						The incomparable educational experience available at many organizations through internship programs is a dream as otherworldly as my first computer. It is an opportunity that can change my life and that of those around me. 
						The saying that it takes a village to raise a child is true; and it takes a computer to raise a village; and an education to raise the computer.</p> -->

										Battleship Game
									</p>
									<p>
										It's a simple battleship game. It's a second version of the game I programmed during the CTD - North Carolina-based online programming school,  web development training. 
										I changed a few rules. Instead of letting users take turns by passing the device back and forth, I displayed both boards on the screen with hidden 'hit' cells. 
										Also, players don't need to write the coordinates but click on a chosen cell. Work in progress on reset button.
									</p>
									<p>
										The graphic design of the game was inspired by retro-futuristic 80's video games.
